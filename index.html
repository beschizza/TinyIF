beach|A sunny beach|Sand stretches for miles either way, disappearing in to the distant haze. [Towering Dunes:dunes] rise inland; the [sea:sea] murmurs and claws at your feet

sea|Waist Deep|Warm water laps at your navel. There's something serene about the glittering waves around you, but there are sharks, and you can't swim. The [beach:beach] is a line of white behind you.

dunes|Towering dunes|All around you, sand curves to the sky in strange shifting heaps. You can hear the hiss of waves on the [beach:beach]. The highest leaves of a [row of palm trees:palms] peek above the sands.

palms|At the tree line|Swaying palms tower over you. Sand gives way underfoot to grass and dirt in the beckoning darkness of the forest. Shadows fall upon the [dunes:dunes].
